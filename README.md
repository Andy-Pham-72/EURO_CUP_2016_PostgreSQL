This repository contains my solutions for EURO_CUP_2016 mini-project questions.
Please run the schema and table scripts that I created for PostgreSQL as [euro_cup_2016_PostgreSQL_andy_pham.sql].
All the solutions in the folder [Solutions] as separated sql files.
The `match_mast.csv` file was cleaned in order to be used with the table setup as `clean_match_mast.csv` file.

- **NOTE**: I also created schema and tables setup for MySQL workbench. However, some adjustments for the CSV files are needed in order to be imported into the tables.
